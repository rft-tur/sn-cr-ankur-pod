Hi, I have a script that looks for server outages by analyzing Traefik server access logs. It works by looking for 10-minute gaps in the log entries and prints them to the user.

Heres a sample log entry

```json
{
    "timestamp": "2025-03-20T08:16:00.121245Z",
    "status": 201,
    "method": "GET",
    "path": "/register",
    "duration_ms": 895,
    "client_ip": "192.168.1.116"
}
```

Heres my code

```python
import json
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

LOG_FILE = 'traefik_logs.json'
GAP_THRESHOLD = timedelta(minutes=10)

def loadLogs():
    with open(LOG_FILE, 'r') as f:
        logs = json.load(f)
    return logs

def detectGaps(logs):
    gaps = []
    if len(logs) < 2:
        return gaps
    
    for log in logs:
        log['timestamp'] = datetime.fromisoformat(log['timestamp'].replace('Z', '+00:00'))
    
    logs.sort(key=lambda x: x['timestamp'])
    
    for i in range(1, len(logs)):
        prevTime = logs[i - 1]['timestamp']
        curr_time = logs[i]['timestamp']
        gap = curr_time - prevTime
        
        if gap >= GAP_THRESHOLD:
            gaps.append({
                'start_time': prevTime.isoformat() + 'Z',
                'end_time': curr_time.isoformat() + 'Z',
                'gap_duration_minutes': gap.total_seconds() / 60
            })
    
    return gaps

def main():
    logs = loadLogs()
    gaps = detectGaps(logs)

    if gaps:
        print(f"\nDetected {len(gaps)} gap(s) of 10+ minutes:\n")
        for gap in gaps:
            print(f"> From {gap['start_time']} to {gap['end_time']} ({gap['gap_duration_minutes']:.2f} minutes)")
    else:
        print("\nNo gaps of 10+ minutes detected.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

Now I want to check if load was an issue for outages. To do that, I will need to calculate the average duration of the last 5 requests before a gap starts. And the script should print the average duration beside the outage start and end time.

Please update the code for me.

**[assistant]**

Here's the step-by-step solution to add an average duration calculation for the last 5 requests before each gap:

Step 1: Understand Code Structure

The current code has two major functions: `logLogs()` and `detectGaps()`. The `logLogs()` reads the Traefik log file. The `detectGaps()` function processes the log entries and returns an array with all the gaps. It first sorts the log entries by timestamp. Then it loops through each entry and checks for gaps over 10-minute period. 

Step 2: Understand User Requirements

User wants to calculate the average duration of the last 5 requests before each gap and include the average in the gap array for printing.

Step 3: Calculate Pre-Gap Durations

For each detected gap, we need to identify up to 5 log entries immediately preceding the gap and extract their 'duration_ms' values. Once we have the durations, we can compute the average duration.

Code Modifications:

```python
# Calculate average of last 5 requests before gap
start_idx = max(0, i - 5)  # Handle beginning of logs
relevant_entries = logs[start_idx:i]
durations = [entry['duration_ms'] for entry in relevant_entries]
avg_duration = sum(durations)/len(durations) if durations else 0.0
```

Step 4: Update Gap Tracking

Add the calculated average duration to the gap dictionary for reporting.

```python
import json
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

LOG_FILE = 'traefik_logs.json'
GAP_THRESHOLD = timedelta(minutes=10)
PRE_GAP_SAMPLE_SIZE = 5


def load_logs():
    """Load and parse Traefik access logs from the configured JSON file.

        list: List of log entries as dictionaries with parsed timestamps

    with open(LOG_FILE, 'r') as f:
        logs = json.load(f)
    return logs

    gaps = []
    if len(logs) < 2:
        return gaps

    for log in logs:
        log['timestamp'] = datetime.fromisoformat(
            log['timestamp'].replace('Z', '+00:00')
        )

    logs.sort(key=lambda x: x['timestamp'])

    for i in range(1, len(logs)):
        prev_time = logs[i - 1]['timestamp']
        curr_time = logs[i]['timestamp']
        gap = curr_time - prev_time

        if gap >= GAP_THRESHOLD:
            # Calculate average duration of preceding requests
            start_idx = max(0, i - PRE_GAP_SAMPLE_SIZE)
            sample_entries = logs[start_idx:i]
            durations = [entry['duration_ms'] for entry in sample_entries]
            avg_duration = sum(durations) / len(durations) if durations else 0

            gaps.append({
                'start_time': prev_time.isoformat().replace('+00:00', 'Z'),
                'end_time': curr_time.isoformat().replace('+00:00', 'Z'),

                'avg_pre_gap_duration': avg_duration
            })

    return gaps


def main():
    """Orchestrate log analysis workflow and present results."""
    logs = load_logs()
    gaps = detect_gaps(logs)

    if gaps:
        print(f"\nDetected {len(gaps)} service gap(s):")
        for gap in gaps:
            print(
                f"* {gap['start_time']} → {gap['end_time']} "
                f"({gap['gap_duration_minutes']:.1f} min gap)\n"
                f"  Avg. response time pre-gap: "
                f"{gap['avg_pre_gap_duration']:.1f}ms\n"
            )
    else:
        print("\nNo significant service gaps detected.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The script now calculates and reports the average load time of the last 5 requests before each detected gap.

Let me know if you’d like to adjust any details!
